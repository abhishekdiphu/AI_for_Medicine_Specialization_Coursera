# Absolute risk reduction:
- Let's say a doctor is trying out a new treatment and wants to see how effective the treatment is going to be for reducing heart attack 

- the doctor try out the treatment on a group of patients and not use the treatment on another group of patients.

-  The group of patients on which the doctor uses the treatment is called the treatment arm, and the group on which the doctor does not use the treatment is called the control, giving  them a placebo, which is a fake treatment that seems like a real treatment or the standard of care,

- So now you would follow these patients for a year and see what fraction of the patients in either group get a heart attack. 

- Let's say after one year you find that 2% get a heart attack in the treatment group, while 5% of the patients in the control group get a heart attack.

-  So we can now express the effect of the treatment.

- Expressing the absolute risk of a heart attack in the treatment and control groups. 

- So in the treatment group, because 2% had a heart attack, the absolute risk is going to be 0.02. 

- Similarly in the control group, because 5% had a heart attack, the absolute risk is going to be 0.05. 

-  So we take 0.05 minus 0.02, which is going to be 0.03, which we call the absolute risk reduction of the treatment which  quantify the difference in risks within with that the treatment arm.


# Randomized control trials (RCT):

- The setup of a medical experiment where we randomly allocate subjects to two or more groups treat them differently and then compare them with respect to a measured response is called a randomized control trial, or RCT. 

- so that biased results are avoided.

- it is also common to calculate p-value to find the significance of the treamtmet effect.

- if effect is = 0.003 ARR , p-value < 0.0001, there is 0.1% prob that we will observe a differnce . it is afunction of no of paitents in a group.
