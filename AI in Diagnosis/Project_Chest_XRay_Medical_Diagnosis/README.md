# Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

- Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
- Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
- Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
- Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC - (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
- Visualize model activity using GradCAMs
